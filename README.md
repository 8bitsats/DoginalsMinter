Dogecoin Inscription Protocol: A Step-by-Step Guide

Prerequisites

Before diving into the world of Dogecoin inscriptions, ensure you have the following prerequisites covered:

Node.js: Essential for running the scripts and commands for inscriptions. 

Visit  to download and install Node.js for your operating system.

Dogecoin RPC Access: You'll need access to a Dogecoin RPC to interact with the blockchain.

 Sign up at  for a shared Dogecoin Node with JSON RPC access. 

Copy your node's address for future use.

Installation

1. Install Dependencies

First, open your terminal and install the necessary dependencies by running:

npm install
2. Setup

Create a .env file in your project directory. 

This file should contain your node information. 

An example .env file is provided below for reference:

NODE_RPC_URL=https://go.getblock.io/YOUR_NODE_INFORMATION_HERE
TESTNET=false
FEE_PER_KB=1000000000

Replace YOUR_NODE_INFORMATION_HERE with your actual node information from GetBlock. 
The FEE_PER_KB is crucial as it determines the fee rate you're willing to pay miners per inscription. 

Always check the current fee rates at  to ensure your transactions are processed timely.


Funding Your Wallet

To mint inscriptions, you'll need DOGE in your wallet. 

Follow these steps to set up and fund your wallet:

Generate a new .wallet.json file:

node . wallet new

Copy the displayed address and send DOGE to it.
Once the DOGE is received, proceed to sync your wallet with the blockchain:

node . wallet sync

For high-volume minting,
 you may need to split your UTXOs for better transaction management:

node . wallet split <count>

Replace <count> with the number of splits you desire. 

Finally, when you're done minting, 

you can send the remaining DOGE back to a specified address:

node . wallet send <address> <optional amount>

Remove the < and > when inputting the address and amount.
